How can GitHub be beneficial to me as a Student?

GitHub is a coding platform that lets you and other people work on projects together. I can use GitHub to further my knowledge on coding. I can also use GitHub as a platform with my friends who might be interested in coding. GitHub would allow me to expand my coding portfolio and increase my knowledge in coding and game development. GitHub allows me to work with teachers and teams on projects.(I also added this information in my ReadMe and I uploaded past work we did on codepen).
